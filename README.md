# Welcome

## Preamble

one thing that a lot of people are going to ask me is 'why is this hosted on Gitbook?' and the answer to that is really simple, they have a lot of things that will help make this documentation rich and easy to read/understand/use. We want to make it as easy and straightforward as possible to contribute to what we are doing and this documenetation will help with that.



for more developer focused documenation, including using our products in your products, we will post that over [here](https://developers.awfixer.com/?contibe-guide)
